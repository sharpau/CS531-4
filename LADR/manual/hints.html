<h1>Hints</h1>

<i>Hint clauses</i> can be used to help guide Prover9's search.
Prover9's input can contain any number of hint lists (which are
simply concatenated by Prover9).

<p>
Each list of hint clauses must start with <tt>formulas(hints).</tt>
and end with <tt>end_of_list</tt>.
Any clause is acceptable as a hint.
For example (the label attributes are optional),

<pre class="my_file">
formulas(hints).
    x ' * (x * y) = y       # label(6).
    x * (x * y) = y         # label(7).
    x * (y * (x * y)) = e   # label(8).
    x ' ' * e = x           # label(9).
    x ' * e = x             # label(10).
    x ' = x                 # label(11).
    x * e = x               # label(12).
    x * (y * x) = y         # label(13).
    x * y = y * x           # label(14).
end_of_list.
</pre>

<p>
A derived clause <i>matches</i> a hint if it subsumes the hint.
If a clause matches more than one hint, the first matching hint
is used.

<blockquote class="otter_diff">
In Otter, "matching a hint" can mean (depending on the parameter
settings) subsumes, subsumed by, or equivalent to.
These other types of matching may be added to Prover9
if there is any demand for them.
</blockquote>

<p>
Hints are used primarily when selecting given clauses.
The mechanism for doing this is the
<a href="select.html">given-clause selection procedure</a>.
In short, the default value of the
<a href="select.html#hints_part"><tt><b>hints_part</b></tt></a>
parameter says to select clauses that match hints (lightest
first) whenever any are available.
<p>
Hints are also used when deciding to keep a new clause.
Clauses that match hints are not deleted by any of the
parameters
<a href="process-inf.html#max_weight"><tt><b>max_weight</b></tt></a>,
<a href="process-inf.html#max_vars"><tt><b>max_vars</b></tt></a>,
<a href="process-inf.html#max_literals"><tt><b>max_literals</b></tt></a>, or
<tt>max_depth</tt>.

<h2>Where do Hints Come From?</h2>

Hints frequently consist of proofs, perhaps many, of related theorems.

<p>
Bob Veroff developed the concept, installing code for hints
in an early version of Otter, to experiment with his method
of <i>proof sketches</i>
[<a href="references.html#Veroff-hints">Veroff-hints</a>,
<a href="references.html#Veroff-sketches">Veroff-sketches</a>].
In the proof sketches
method, a difficult conjecture is attacked by first proving
several (or many) weakened variants of the conjecture, and
using those proofs as hints to guide searches for a proof
of the original conjecture.

<p>
The program <a href="prooftrans.html">Prooftrans</a>, which is distributed
along with Prover9, can be used to extract proofs from a Prover9
output file and transform the proofs to lists of hints suitable
for input to subsequent Prover9 jobs.

<h2>An Example</h2>

This example consists of four jobs.  The first is a proof of a nontrivial
theorem called "hard".  The other three jobs prove the hard theorem
indirectly by first proving an easier theorem (in this case, the easier
theorem simply the harder theorem with an extra assumption); then using
the proof of the easier theorem as hints to help prove the hard theorem.

<ol>
<li>A Prover9 job that proves the hard theorem.
<pre class="my_job">
prover9 -f <a href="hard.in">hard.in</a> &gt; <a href="hard.out">hard.out</a>
</pre>
<li>A proof of the easier thorem.
<pre class="my_job">
prover9 -f <a href="easy.in">easy.in</a> &gt; <a href="easy.out">easy.out</a>
</pre>
<li>A Prooftrans job converts the proof of the easier theorem into a list of hints.
<pre class="my_job">
prooftrans hints -f <a href="easy.out">easy.out</a> &gt; <a href="easy.hints">easy.hints</a>
</pre>
<li>A Prover9 job that uses the hints to prove the harder theorem.
<pre class="my_job">
prover9 -f <a href="hard.in">hard.in</a> <a href="easy.hints">easy.hints</a>  &gt; <a href="hard-hints.out">hard-hints.out</a>
</pre>
</ol>

Proving the hard theorem indirectly (jobs 2,3,4) takes about 1/4 the
time as proving it directly (job 1).  Of course the difficult and
interesting part of working this way is finding good "easy" theorems.

<h2>Special Weight Assignments</h2>

When the given clause selection procedure calls for
a clause that matches a hint, the lightest such clause is chosen.
Ordinarily, clauses that match hints are weighed just as any other clause
is weighed.
However, if one believes some hints are more important that others,
one can, in effect, say "any clause that matches this hint gets
a specific weight".  This is accomplished by attaching a <tt>bsub_hint_wt</tt>
attribute to the hint, as in the following example.
<pre class="my_file">
formulas(hints).
  x ' * (x * y) = y     # label("very important hint") # bsub_hint_wt(-100).
end_of_list.
</pre>

Another way to assign a special weight is with the following flag.

<!-- start option breadth_first_hints -->
<a name="breadth_first_hints">
<pre class="my_option">
set(breadth_first_hints).
clear(breadth_first_hints).    % default clear
</pre>

<blockquote>
Setting this flag causes all clauses that match hints to receive weight 0.
The effect is as if each hint had the attribute <tt>bsub_hint_wt(0)</tt>.
This causes clauses that match hints to be selected in the order they
are generated.
</blockquote>
<!-- end option -->

<p>
The weight assigned by any of the preceding methods may be modified
if the flag <a href="hints.html#degrade_hints"><tt><b>degrade_hints</b></tt></a> is set.

<h2>Hint Degradation</h2>

In many searches that use hints, a given hint can match many different
derived clauses.  As a hint matches more and more clauses, we wish
its influence to diminish.
This is the idea behind Veroff's <i>hint degradation</i> method.

<!-- start option degrade_hints -->
<a name="degrade_hints">
<pre class="my_option">
set(degrade_hints).    % default set
clear(degrade_hints).
</pre>

<blockquote>
If this flag is set, a weight penalty is added to clauses that match
hints that have been previously matched.  The following procedure
is used.  Given a newly derived clause, say <i>C</i>, assume we find
a hint that matches the clause; let <i>n</i> be the number of times the hint
has already been matched; then the weight of <i>C</i> is increased
by (<i>n</i> * 1000).  In other words, 1000 is added for each
previous match of the hint.
<p>
The effect of this procedure is (usually) that clauses matching hints
are selected in the following order:
clauses matching hints that have <i>not</i> been matched before,
clauses matching hints that have been matched <i>once</i> before, and so on.
</blockquote>
<!-- end option -->

<h2>Keeping/Limiting Clauses the Match Hints</h2>

Ordinarily, when a clause matching a hint is derived,
the clause will be retained even if it violates limits
such as <tt>max_weight</tt>.  Setting the following flag
will cause those limits to be applied to such clauses,
and it may be useful with trying to simplify known proofs.

<!-- start option limit_hint_matchers -->
<a name="limit_hint_matchers">
<pre class="my_option">
set(limit_hint_matchers).
clear(limit_hint_matchers).    % default clear
</pre>

<blockquote>
If this flag is set, the parameters
<tt>max_weight</tt>,
<tt>max_literals</tt>,
<tt>max_depth</tt>, and
<tt>max_vars</tt>
will be applied to clauses that match hints (as well as to
clauses that don't match hints).
<p>
Otherwise (the default), those limits will not be
applied to clauses that match hints.
</blockquote>
<!-- end option -->

<h2>Back Demodulation of Hints</h2>

When hints come from proofs in which equality and rewriting
play a major role, they may have trouble guiding a search,
because the rewriting may occur in different ways in the
new search.  In particular, a hint may fail to match a
clause, because the clause has been rewritten and the hint
has not.  This is the motivation for the following feature.

<!-- start option back_demod_hints -->
<a name="back_demod_hints">
<pre class="my_option">
set(back_demod_hints).    % default set
clear(back_demod_hints).
</pre>

<blockquote>
If this flag is set, hints are back demodulated.  That is, they
are kept simplified with respect to the current set of demodulators.
</blockquote>
<!-- end option -->

<h2>Labels on Hints</h2>

Label attributes on hint clauses get special treatment.  When a hint containing
a label matches a clause, the label attribute is copied to the clause.

<p>
The following flag addresses the situation in which the input contains
sets of equivalent hints.  (This situation frequently occurs when the
hints contain many proofs of similar theorems.)

<!-- start option collect_hint_labels -->
<a name="collect_hint_labels">
<pre class="my_option">
set(collect_hint_labels).
clear(collect_hint_labels).    % default clear
</pre>

<blockquote>
If this flag is set, and the hints list contains a set of equivalent hints,
only the first copy of the hint is retained.  However, the labels from
all of the other equivalent hints are collected and put on the retained
copy.  When a clause matches the retained hint, it gets copies of all of the
labels from the equivalent hints.
<p>
If this flag is clear, when a clause matches a set of equivalent hints,
it receives the label (if any) from the first copy only.
</blockquote>
