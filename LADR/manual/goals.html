<h1>Goals and Denials</h1>

This section shows how the conclusion(s) of a conjecture
can be stated in positive form, how one can search for
direct proofs as opposed to bidirectional proofs, and
how multiple conclusions are stated and handled.

<p>
Terminology
<ul>
<li><i>Conclusion</i>: this term is used informally.
<li><i>Goal</i>: this term refers to a conclusion stated in positive form.
<li><i>Denial clause</i>: this term refers to a negative clause in a
<a href="glossary.html#horn">Horn set</a>,
because such clauses usually correspond to the negation
of a conclusion.
</ul>

<h2>Goals: Stating Conclusions in Positive Form</h2>

<blockquote class="otter_diff">
In Otter, the conclusions are always stated in negated form.
</blockquote>

Prover9 allows the user to state conclusions in positive
form by using the list
<tt>formulas(goals)</tt>.
However, Prover9 always works by refutation, so 
the clauses or formulas in the <tt>goals</tt> lists
are negated as described below, and the
results are appended to the <tt>sos</tt> clause list
before the search starts.
In other words, goals are "syntactic sugar"
for input, and have nothing to do with the way Prover9
conducts its search for refutations.

<p>
When the conclusion is given in positive form, the
user has no control over the <a href="glossary.html#skolemization">Skolem</a> symbols (if any)
that Prover9 introduces.  If the user needs some control
of the Skolem symbols, for example, to insert them
into the symbol precedence at a particular spot,
or to include them in the weighting function,
the user should do the Skolemizing and give the
conclusion in negated form.

<p>
If there is just one formula in <tt>formulas(goals)</tt>,
the meaning is clear: the formula is processed by
first taking its universal closure, then negating.
The formula is then handled exactly as if it had
been input in <tt>formulas(sos)</tt>, that is, by
Skolemizing and transforming to clauses.

<h3>Multiple Goals</h3>

<p>
If there is more than one formula in <tt>formulas(goals)</tt>,
the meaning is not clear.  Is the conclusion the
disjunction of those formulas?  Or the conjunction?
<i>The answer: disjunction</i>: if any goal is proved,
the proof is reported, printed, and counted.

<p>
Multiple <i>complex</i> goals are not allowed, because
the quantification of free variables can be very confusing.
Therefore Prover9 enforces the following rule.

<blockquote>
<i>If there is more than one formula in the goals list,
each must be a positive universal conjunctive formula, that is
a formula constructed from atomic formulas, universal
quantification, and conjunction only.</i>
</blockquote>

To avoid this restriction, one can always
write the conclusion clearly as a single goal formula
containing any of the logic connectives and quantification.
However, if the conjecture involves multiple
complex conclusions, we recommend, for search efficiency,
separate Prover9 searches.

<p>
If there are multiple goals, each is processed separately
by applying universal closure, negation, and transformation
to clauses.  After this processing, Prover9 forgets that
there were multiple goals and simply searches for
refutations.

<p>
When there are multiple goals,
and when the user wishes to prove more than one goal,
the parameter <a href="goals.html#max_proofs"><tt><b>max_proofs</b></tt></a> should be set to an
appropriate value.  (The flag <a href="goals.html#auto_denials"><tt><b>auto_denials</b></tt></a>
(default set) can do so automatically.)

<h2>Multiple Proofs</h2>

<!-- start option max_proofs -->
<a name="max_proofs">
<pre class="my_option">
assign(max_proofs, <i>n</i>).  % default <i>n</i>=1, range [-1 .. <tt>INT_MAX</tt>]
</pre>

<blockquote>
This parameter tells Prover9 to stop searching when the
<i>n</i>-th proof has been found.
</blockquote>
<!-- end option -->

<h2>Denials: Negative Clauses in Horn Sets</h2>

Denial clauses (negative clauses in Horn sets)
can be derived from goals,
or they can be input directly as negative clauses.

<h3>Forward or Direct Proofs</h3>

<p>
The following flag restricts the use of negative clauses in
Horn sets, with the aim of finding proofs that are more direct, that
is, proofs that go forward from the hypotheses to the conclusion
rather than proofs that reason backward from the conclusion.

<!-- start option restrict_denials -->
<a name="restrict_denials">
<pre class="my_option">
set(restrict_denials).
clear(restrict_denials).    % default clear
</pre>

<blockquote>
<p>
This flag applies only to Horn sets.
If the flag is set, negative clauses (clauses in which all
literals are negative) in Horn sets are referred to as
<i>restricted denials</i> and are given special treatment.
<p>
The inference rules (i.e., paramodulation and the
resolution rules) will not be applied to restricted denials.
However, restricted denials will be simplified by
<a href="glossary.html#demodulation">back demodulation</a> and <a href="glossary.html#unit-deletion">back unit deletion</a>.
<p>
In addition, restricted denials will not be deleted if they
are over the weight limit (<a href="process-inf.html#max_weight"><tt><b>max_weight</b></tt></a>).
<p>
The effect of setting <a href="goals.html#restrict_denials"><tt><b>restrict_denials</b></tt></a> is that proofs
of Horn sets will usually be more forward or direct.
This option can speed up proofs, it can delay proofs, and it can
block all proofs.
</blockquote>
<!-- end option -->

<h3>Multiple Proofs of the Same Conclusion</h3>

<!-- start option reuse_denials -->
<a name="reuse_denials">
<pre class="my_option">
set(reuse_denials).
clear(reuse_denials).    % default clear
</pre>

<blockquote>
If this flag is set, when a denial clause
(a negative clause in a Horn set) is used in
a proof, and when <a href="goals.html#max_proofs"><tt><b>max_proofs</b></tt></a> says
to search for more proofs, subsequent proofs
may be of the same conclusion.  (Multiple
proofs of the same conclusion may be useful
when one is searching for <i>short</i> proofs.)
<p>
If this flag is clear, then when a proof is found,
the denial and all of its descendants are disabled so that they
will not appear in subsequent proofs.
<p>
This flag is independent of the flag
<a href="goals.html#restrict_denials"><tt><b>restrict_denials</b></tt></a>.
</blockquote>
<!-- end option -->

<h3>Auto_denials</h3>

<!-- start option auto_denials -->
<a name="auto_denials">
<pre class="my_option">
set(auto_denials).    % default set
clear(auto_denials).
</pre>

<blockquote>
If this flag is set (the default), negative clauses in
<a href="glossary.html#horn">Horn sets</a> 
receive some special initial processing.
<p>
If a Horn set has more than one denial (negative) clause, we
assume they correspond to separate conclusions, and the user
wishes to have a separate proof of each conclusion.
Therefore, if 
<a href="goals.html#max_proofs"><tt><b>max_proofs</b></tt></a>
has not been changed from its default value of 1,
we assign to
<a href="goals.html#max_proofs"><tt><b>max_proofs</b></tt></a>
the number of negative clauses.
(Note that when
<a href="goals.html#reuse_denials"><tt><b>reuse_denials</b></tt></a>
is clear (the default),
Prover9 prevents multiple proofs of the same conclusion.)
<p>
Also, if a negative clause in a Horn set has label attribute
but no answer attribute, the clause is given an answer attribute
corresponding to the first label attribute.  This saves the user
from changing "label" to "answer" when moving formulas from
the <tt>sos</tt> list to the <tt>goals</tt> list.
</blockquote>
<!-- end option -->

<h2>An Example</h2>

The following example illustrates multiple goals
(including a goal that is a combination of other goals),
<a href="goals.html#auto_denials"><tt><b>auto_denials</b></tt></a>,
and
<a href="goals.html#restrict_denials"><tt><b>restrict_denials</b></tt></a>.
