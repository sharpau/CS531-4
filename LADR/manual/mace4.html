<h1>Mace4 (Models And CounterExamples)</h1>

The program 
<a href="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~mccune/mace4/">Mace4</a>
[<a href="references.html#McCune-Mace4">McCune-Mace4</a>]
searches for finite structures satisfying first-order
and equational statements, the same kind of statement that
Prover9 accepts.  If the statement is the denial of
some conjecture, any structures found by Mace4 are
counterexamples to the conjecture.

<p>
Mace4 can be a valuable complement to Prover9, looking
for counterexamples before (or at the same time as)
using Prover9 to search for a proof.  It can also be
used to help debug input clauses and formulas for
Prover9.

<p>
For the most part, Mace4 accepts the same input files
as Prover9.  If the input file contains commands that
Mace4 does not understand, then the argument "-c"
must be given to tell Mace4 to ignore those commands.

<p>
For example, say we're learning group theory,
and we're wondering whether all groups are commutative.
We can run the following two jobs in parallel,
with Prover9 looking for a proof, and Mace4 looking
for a counterexample.

<pre class="my_job">
prover9  -f <a href="x2.in">x2.in</a> &gt; <a href="x2.prover9.out">x2.prover9.out</a>
mace4 -c -f <a href="x2.in">x2.in</a> &gt; <a href="x2.mace4.out">x2.mace4.out</a>
</pre>

<p>

Most of the options accepted by Mace4 can be given either on the
command line or in the input file.
The following command lists the command-line options accepted by Mace4.
<pre class="my_job">
mace4 -help
</pre>

<p>
<b>Terminology</b>.  We use the terms <i>interpretation</i>,
<i>model</i>, and <i>structure</i> for the objects that Mace4 produces.
From a logic point of view, Mace4 produces interpretations which
are models of the input formulas.  From a math point of view,
Mace4 produces structures satisfying the input formulas.

<h2>What Mace4 Does</h2>

Mace4 searches for <i>unsorted finite structures</i> only.
That is, a structure (model) has one underlying
finite set, called the <i>domain</i>
(the members are always 0,1,...,<i>n-1</i>
for a set of size <i>n</i>), and structures are
functions and relations (tables) over the domain, corresponding
to the operations and relation symbols in the specification.

<p>
By default, Mace4 starts searching for a structure of
domain size 2, and then it increments the size until
it succeeds or reaches some limit.

<h2>The Original Mace4 Manual</h2>

<p>
The 
original Mace4 manual
[<a href="references.html#McCune-Mace4">McCune-Mace4</a>]
(<a href="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~mccune/prover9/mace4.pdf">PDF)</a>
is out of date with respect to features and options,
but it contains useful information on
the history of Mace4, details on the search methods, and 
the differences between Mace2 and Mace4.
