<h1>Goals</h1>

This section shows how the conclusion(s) of a conjecture
can be stated in positive form, how one can search for
direct proofs as opposed to bidirectional proofs, and
how multiple conclusions are stated and handled.

<h2>Stating Conclusions in Positive Form</h2>

<blockquote class="otter_diff">
In Otter, the conclusions are always stated in negated form.
</blockquote>

Prover9 allows the user to state conclusions in positive
form by using the lists <tt>clauses(goals)</tt> and
<tt>formulas(goals)</tt>.
However, Prover9 always works by refutation, so 
the clauses or formulas in the <tt>goals</tt> lists
are negated as described below, and the
results are appended to the <tt>sos</tt> clause list
before the search starts.

<p>
If there is just one clause in <tt>clauses(goals)</tt>,
the meaning is clear, and the clause is processed by
taking first taking universal closure, then negating.
The formula is then handled exactly as if it had
been input in <tt>formulas(sos)</tt>, that is, by
Skolemizing and transforming to clauses.

<p>
If there is just one formula in <tt>formulas(goals)</tt>,
the meaning is clear, and
it is simply negated and then Skolemized as usual.

<p>
If there is more than one clause in <tt>clauses(goals)</tt>
or more than one formula in <tt>formulas(goals)</tt>, the
meaning is not clear.  For example, if there are two
clauses in <tt>clauses(goals)</tt>, is the conclusion
the disjunction or the conjunction of those clauses?
What does a list of goal clauses mean if some of them are
non-units or non-positive?

<p>
To simplify the meanings of multiple goals, the following
restrictions are in place.

<ul>
<li>All clauses in <tt>clauses(goals)</tt> must be positive units.
<li>At most one formula is accepted in <tt>formulas(goals)</tt>.
<li>One cannot input both <tt>clauses(goals)</tt> and <tt>formulas(goals)</tt>.
</ul>

To avoid any of these restrictions, one can always
write the conclusions clearly as a single formula for
<tt>formulas(goals)</tt>.

<p>
When there are multiple goals in <tt>clauses(goals)</tt>,
should the proofs of the goals be presented together as one proof
or as separate proofs?  We have chosen the latter for the simple
reason that if any goal is proved, we wish to have a proof.

<h2>Forward or Direct Proofs</h2>

This subsection refers to the negative clauses that exist at the start
of the search.  These include ones that are input, ones that are
derived from ordinary Skolemization, and those that are derived from
<tt>clauses(goals)</tt> and <tt>formulas(goals)</tt>.

<p>
The following flag restricts the use of negative clauses,
with the aim of finding proofs that are more direct.  That
is, proofs that go forward from the hypotheses to the conclusion
rather than proofs that reason backward from the conclusion.
The secondary effect of this flag is that when there are
multiple conclusions, Prover9 will not give more than one
proof of the same conclusion.

<!-- start option restrict_denials -->
<a name="restrict_denials">
<pre class="my_option">
set(restrict_denials).
clear(restrict_denials).    % default clear
</pre>

<blockquote>
<p>
If this flag is set, negative clauses (clauses in which all
literals are negative) are given special treatment.  At the start
of the search, they are moved to a list <tt>denials</tt>, and during
the search, only a subset of the ordinary operations are applied
to them.
<p>
The clauses will <i>not</i> be selected as
<g>given clause</g>s,
so the ordinary inference rules of the search will not be applied to them.
The following operations <i>will</i> be applied to the clauses:
back demodulation, back unit deletion, unit conflict.
<p>
The effect of setting restrict_denials is that proofs
will usually be more forward or direct.
This option can speed up proofs, it can delay proofs, and it can
block all proofs.
<p>
In addition, when a clause in list <tt>denials</tt> is used in a proof,
it is disabled (unless the flag <a href="process-inf.html#reuse_denials"><tt><b>reuse_denials</b></tt></a> is set).
When multiple proofs are sought (see <a href="limits.html#max_proofs"><tt><b>max_proofs</b></tt></a>), this prevents
more than one proof of the same theorem.
</blockquote>
<!-- end option -->

<h2>Handling Multiple Conclusions</h2>

<!-- start option max_proofs -->
<a name="max_proofs">
<pre class="my_option">
assign(max_proofs, <i>n</i>).  % default <i>n</i>=1, range [-1 .. INT_MAX]
</pre>

<blockquote>
This parameter tells Prover9 to stop searching when the
<i>n</i>-th proof has been found.
If the user asks for more than one proof by changing this parameter,
the flag <a href="goals.html#restrict_denials"><tt><b>restrict_denials</b></tt></a> will be automatically set.
This option dependency prevents multiple proofs of the same theorem.

<p>
Note that the flag <a href="goals.html#restrict_denials"><tt><b>restrict_denials</b></tt></a> can substantially
alter the search, so one must be aware of situations like the
following.  One runs a job that finds a quick proof of a single goal;
then a second job is run, containing a second goal and also
<tt>assign(max_proofs,2)</tt>; the first goal may no longer be proved,
because the first proof has bidirectional reasoning which
is not allowed by <a href="goals.html#restrict_denials"><tt><b>restrict_denials</b></tt></a>.

<p>
Of course, the option dependency can be undone with
<tt>clear(restrict_denials)</tt>.
</blockquote>
<!-- end option -->

<h2>Multiple Proofs of the Same Conclusion</h2>

If the flag <a href="goals.html#restrict_denials"><tt><b>restrict_denials</b></tt></a> is set, and
if there are multiple denials, then by default, when
a denial is refuted, it is disabled so that it is not
refuted again later in the search.  The following flag
allows for multiple refutations using the same denial.

<!-- start option reuse_denials -->
<a name="reuse_denials">
<pre class="my_option">
set(reuse_denials).
clear(reuse_denials).    % default clear
</pre>

<blockquote>
If this flag is set, when a clause in list <tt>denials</tt>
(which gets there by flag <a href="goals.html#restrict_denials"><tt><b>restrict_denials</b></tt></a>),
occurs in a proof, it is <i>not</i> disabled, allowing
it to occur in subsequent proofs.
</blockquote>
