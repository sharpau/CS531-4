<h1>Term Ordering</h1>

<blockquote class="otter_diff">
Prover9's term ordering procedures and options are simpler than
Otter's, but  somewhat less flexible.
We recommend that those who use Otter's "ad hoc" ordering try
Prover9's KBO ordering.
</blockquote>

<p>
Prover9 has available several methods for comparing terms.
(Although 
<g>atomic formula</g>s,
<g>literal</g>s, and
<g>clauses</g> are not,
strictly speaking,
<g><i>terms</i></g>,
the term orderings we
write about here apply to those objects as well.)
<p>
The term orderings are partial (and sometimes total on ground terms),
and they are used in two ways.
<ul>
<li>To orient equalities (positive and negative).  If one side of the
equality is greater than the other, the greater side is placed on the
left-hand side, and the equality is marked as oriented.
<li>To decide which literals in clauses are admissible
for application of inference rules.  Several of the resolution and
paramodulation rules require that some of the literals be
maximal in their clause.
</ul>

<p>
For many problems, especially those involving equality,
a good term ordering can determine the difference between
success and failure.
The default settings work well in many cases, but many difficult
problems require adjustments to the term ordering.

<p>
The primary choice (via parameter <a href="term-order.html#order"><tt><b>order</b></tt></a>)
is type of ordering: LPO, RPO, or KBO.
Each of those types uses a symbol precedence (see the
<a href="input.html#lex"><tt>lex</tt> command</a>), and KBO
also uses a symbol weighting function (see the
<a href="input.html#kb_weights"><tt>terms(kb_weights)</tt> command</a>).
In addition, the options
<a href="term-order.html#eq_defs"><tt><b>eq_defs</b></tt></a> and 
<a href="term-order.html#inverse_order"><tt><b>inverse_order</b></tt></a>
cause changes to the term ordering.

<p>
See
[<a href="references.html#Dershowitz-termination">Dershowitz-termination</a>]
for a survey on term ordering.

<h2>The Primary Choice</h2>

The <i>symbol precedence</i> is is a total order on function and
predicate symbols (including constants).  The symbol weighting
function maps symbols to nonnegative integers.

<ul>

<li>LPO (Lexicographic Path Ordering).  The term ordering is determined
entirely by the symbol precedence.  It is total on ground terms.

<li>RPO (Recursive Path Ordering).  The term ordering is determined
entirely by the symbol precedence.  It is not necessarily total
on ground terms, because the order of subterms is not considered.

<li>KBO (Knuth-Bendix Ordering).  This ordering uses a weighting
function on symbols as well as the symbol precedence.  The
weighting function is used first, and the symbol precedence
breaks ties.  It is total on ground terms.

</ul>

<p>
KBO is perhaps the most natural of the three,
because it it based on weights of symbols, but it is more cumbersome
to specify because it is determined both by the symbol weights and
by the symbol precedence.  However, if one of the two terms being
compared has more occurrences of a variable, it cannot be smaller.
For example, the distributivity equation cannot be oriented so that
it distributes (expands) terms.

<p>
LPO is perhaps the most powerful of the three, because it can usually
orient more equations.  However, it allows rewrite rules that
expand terms in explosive ways, for example (this is from a real problem),
<blockquote>
<tt>(x * y) * z</tt>  rewrites to    <tt>E * (x * (E * (x * (E * (y * (E * (x * (E * (x * (E * z))))))))))</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
RPO is perhaps the least useful of the three, because it is not necessarily
total on ground terms.  That is, not all ground equations can be oriented.
Also, see the sections on
<a href="process-inf.html#demod-options">demodulation options</a> and on
<a href="inf-rules.html">inference rules</a>.

<p>
The reasonable choice is usually between LPO (the default) and KBO.
For many problems, either one is good.  The main reason LPO is the
the default is that it is a bit faster than KBO.

<p>
Here is the primary option.

<!-- start option order -->
<a name="order">
<pre class="my_option">
assign(order, <i>string</i>).  % default <i>string</i>=lpo, range [lpo,rpo,kbo]
</pre>

<blockquote>
This option is used to select the primary term ordering to be used
for orienting equalities and for determining maximal literals in clauses.
The choices are
<tt>lpo</tt> (Lexicographic Path Ordering),
<tt>rpo</tt> (Recursive Path Ordering), and
<tt>kbo</tt> (Knuth-Bendix Ordering).
</blockquote>
<!-- end option -->

<h2>Termination of Demodulation</h2>

If each member of a set of demodulators (rewrite rules) is oriented
with respect to the current ordering (LPO, RPO, or KBO), then
demodulation (term rewriting) is guaranteed to terminate (in theory) on all
terms, regardless of the the order in which the demodulators are
applied or the order in which the subject terms are demodulated.
However, there are sets of demodulators that are intractable in practice.

<h2>The Default Term Ordering</h2>

The default symbol precedence (for LPO, RPO, and KBO) is given by the following rules (in order).
<ul>
<li>function symbols &lt; negation symbol &lt; non-equality predicate symbols &lt; equality symbol;
<li>if the term ordering is KBO, and if there is exactly one unary function in the problem,
    that function is greater than all other functions;
<li>arity-0 &lt; arity-2 &lt; arity-1 &lt; arity-3 &lt; arity-4 ...  (note the position of arity-1);
<li>non-Skolem symbols &lt; Skolem symbols;
<li>for Skolem symbols, the lower index is the lesser;
<li>for non-Skolem symbols, more occurrences &lt; fewer occurrences;
<li>the lexical ASCII ordering (UNIX strcmp() function).
</ul>
The specific symbol precedence for a problem is given in the output
file in the section <tt>PROCESS INPUT</tt>.

<p>
The default symbol-weighting function for KBO is given by the following rules.
<ul>
<li>Variables have weight 1;
<li>if there is exactly one unary function in the problem, it has weight 0;
<li>all other symbols have weight 1.
</ul>

<h2>Adjustments to the Term Ordering </h2>

<h3>The Lex Command</h3>

The lex command is used to assign a symbol precedence.
It contains a list of symbols ordered by increasing precedence.
For example,
<pre class="my_file">
lex([a, b, c, +, *, h, g]).   % a &lt; b &lt; c &lt; + &lt; * &lt; h &lt; g
</pre>
If there are symbols in the problem that do not appear in
the lex command, a warning is issued, and Prover9 will complete
the precedence inserting the missing symbols at the beginning of the
precedence using its default rules.  In these cases, the
user should check that Prover9 has constructed a reasonable
precedence.

<p>
Note that Skolem symbols cannot appear in a lex command, because
Skolem symbols do not exits at the time the lex command is
written.  If there is a lex command, and if Skolem symbols are
generated, they will handled as missing symbols, as described
in the preceding paragraph.

<blockquote class="otter_diff">
Otter's lex command has a syntax that shows the
arities of the symbols; Prover9's lex command lists only the symbols.
The arities are not necessary for Prover9,
because a string cannot represent two symbols with different arities.
</blockquote>

<h3>The KBO Weights</h3>

If the term ordering is KBO, <tt>assign(<tt>order</tt>, kbo)</tt>, the user
can change the default symbol-weighting function.  For example,
<pre class="my_file">
terms(kbo_weights).
  a = 3.
  b = 2.
  * = 5.
  j = 22.
end_of_list.
</pre>
(This has no relationship to the term-weighting function for
selecting the given clause and discarding inferred clauses.)

<p>
If any symbols are absent from the list, they retain their
default KBO weights of 1.
The symbol weights must be greater than 0, with the exception
that there may be one unary symbol of weight 0.  (The definition
of KBO allows for one unary symbol of weight 0 which must also
be greatest in the precedence.  This special case allows an
such as <tt>g(f(x,y)) = f(g(y),g(x))</tt> to be oriented as
shown and used as a rewrite rule.)

<h3>Term Ordering Options</h3>

<!-- start option inverse_order -->
<a name="inverse_order">
<pre class="my_option">
set(inverse_order).    % default set
clear(inverse_order).
</pre>

<blockquote>
If this flag is set, if there is no
<a href="input.html#lex_command">lex command</a>
(which defines the symbol precedence), and if the term ordering is
LPO or RPO, then Prover9
will attempt to adjust the default symbol precedence if there are any
input equations that specify an inverse operation.   For example,
if <tt>f(x,g(x)) = c</tt> is input, <tt>g</tt> will be placed after
<tt>f</tt> in the precedence.  This allows an equation such as
<tt>g(f(x,y)) = f(g(y),g(x))</tt> to be oriented as shown for
demodulation and paramodulation.  If this flag is set, the
<tt>PROCESS INPUT</tt> section of the output file shows how
the flag changes the symbol precedence.
</blockquote>
<!-- end option -->

<!-- start option eq_defs -->
<a name="eq_defs">
<pre class="my_option">
assign(eq_defs, <i>string</i>).  % default <i>string</i>=unfold, range [unfold,fold,pass]
</pre>

<blockquote>
If <i>string</i>=unfold, and if the input contains an equational
definition, say <tt>j(x,y) = f(f(x,x),f(y,y))</tt>, the defined
symbol <tt>j</tt> will be eliminated from the problem before
the search starts.
This procedure works by adjusting the symbol precedence so that
the defining equation becomes a demodulator.
If there is more than one equational definition, cycles are
avoided by choosing a cycle-free subset of the definitions.
If the primary term ordering is KBO, this option may
admit demodulators that do not satisfy the KBO ordering,
because a variable may have more variables on the right-hand side.
However, this exception is safe (does not cause non-termination).
<p>
If <i>string</i>=fold, and if the input contains an equational
definition, say <tt>j(x,y) = f(f(x,x),f(y,y))</tt>, the term
ordering will be adjusted so that equation is flipped
and becomes a demodulator which introduces the defined symbol
whenever possible during the search.
<p>
If <i>string</i>=pass, nothing special happens.  In this case,
functions may still be unfolded or folded if the term ordering
and symbol precedence happen to arrange the demodulators to do so.
